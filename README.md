## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About 
  Mangoes is an application that simmulates a online reader. Focused in manga (the japanese comics), it uses AniList's GraphQL API for most of it's data fetching and a custom Hygraph GraphQL API for aditional data. It also counts with Firebase Authentication.
  
  You can browse through the main page suggested or search for your favorite mangas by your own!

  After selecting your favorite manga, you can see a lot of it's information as genres, status and more. It's also possible to save it to "My List" by clicking on the button beside the manga's title.

  When you choose the desired volume, it's shown data of the specific volume and it's chapters.
